            "Kanye is a good artist and a decent (and articulate) guy \u2014 more talented than Jay Z.",
            "May GOD Watch over Kanye West \ud83d\ude4f Amen",
            "Kanye doesn\u2019t need Jay Z. He is capable of doing well on his own. I think many people tried to take advantage of Kanye because he is an honest, caring man. The Kardashians really did a job on him.",
            "God be with Kanye",
            "I never liked Kanye songs, it's not my type. But now I like him, the person. He's genuine. He speaks the truth. JayZ and B obviously sold their souls because it's pretty normal in the industry. That's the only way to get so much power. I'm glad Ye is true to himself.",
            "I pray God watches over him, and no weapon formed against him will prosper.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",
            "Kanye\u2764the dark always comes to the light",
            "Kanye is a smart guy. The other artist want to control him.",
            "So Jay didn't even want to sign him. Wowwww. After all the hits. I'm surprised Kanye ever forgave him. This man seriously struggled. And makes amaz8ng music. Jay does to of course. I just always thought he brought Ka years in the rap game.",
            "I will never trust Jay Z.",
            "TBH I've always felt they didn't respect Ye but knew they needed him. He was saying things he wasn't supposed to be saying and Jay Z being the sell out that he was, refused to Push Ye. When he realized what JayZ was about Ye started telling you in his music. Go back and listen to the Graduation album. The whole \"LA, la, La La wait til I get my money right... then you can't tell me nothing right?\" \ud83e\udd23 The man is a genius.",
            "Friendships are fragile, especially where you have friends who have strong ideas about dos and don'ts and an awareness of what they do not want ... So maybe there was a good friendship and good relationship up until a point where it became clear that unwanted things would certainly arrive through a certain friend, and, the friendship is not for abuse, you know? Like, just because we're friends, it doesn't mean I'm going to put up with that or suddenly accept that ... Instead, it's better that you go your way ... I cannot say that I'm much different from that, because I wouldn't attempt to control you, so if you're doing some things that I'm uncomfortable with or that I am less interested in, then the best thing is that I distance myself from you, and, if I need to distance myself from you, then encouraging you to distance yourself from me is also positive for the purpose ... Seeing this, I have to suggest that there's some respect missing, like, we have to respect either way what other people want and do not want, and it's a two-way thing, where I wouldn't try to control you, nor will I allow you to control me.",
            "I believe in mind control in this world we call entertainment Hollywood.",
            "Kanye said he is the most successful person he knows,he's not lying,him and Kim became billionaires,Jay is the only billionaire in his family",
            "God's with you my brother. just keep trusting him. He will protect you .",
            "Ye spits the truth if asked. He never initiates spillin' the tea on anyone. He's not crazy, vindictive or petty. He saw the underbelly of Fame, fortune, and power and it went against everything his mother taught him and who HE is as a man and an artist. I hope Kim & her entire family accept Jesus as their personal savior like Ye. She and family need to come out of that Satanic circle they are in for their sakes and that of their children. All deals with the devil have an expiration date and when it's that time, it never ends well for that individual. Z & B are so deep in the illuminati they can backstroke in it. Not realizing or just not caring that they're only useful to illuminati as long as they can pack stadiums and their music/lyrics can influence it's listeners. Once they can't do that, they might find themselves one day waking up on a Satanic sacrificial alter and people drinking their blood.  Same with Puff. Think the illuminati isn't going to get back the billion plus dollars they are collectively worth? Hell yeah they are! So don't be surprised if you see headlines of these people involved in a plane crash, car accident, shot by a crazy fan, etc;  All I can say is what my Lord Jesus Christ asked \" What profiteth a man to gain the whole world, only to lose his eternal soul\"? \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe -King James Bible book of Ephesians chapter 8 verse 36.  Which means what good is money, power, fame when you die? You can't take a penny of it with you. But you sold your soul to the devil to obtain it. Now when you die, heaven will not be your ETERNAL destination. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",

            "\"Stealing Zayn\"? Zayn is Gigis Baby Daddy, but they have separated 2 years ago, so why \"stealing\"?",
            "I think it's okay. It's not like he cheated on Gigi. I'm happy for Selena \u2764",
            "i\u2019m happy for the both of them , they seem like a cute couple to me. plus there we\u2019re signs \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "i think its ok :) as long selena is happy and i dont want to see her heartbroken again :)",
            "Let\u2019s not. How are you gonna steal someone who\u2019s been single for years? Selena and Zayn look good together. They probably would have dated before had their paths not had them fall for other people. Now might be there time.",
            "As a fan of SELENA i would rather choose CHARLIE PUTH for her bcs i see how charlie really like her and i can sense that he is a protecting BF to SELENA if ever thats why i want CHARLIE for SELENA whos with me bout this team?\u263a\ud83e\udd17",
            "Zayn good choice!  She'll be a wonderful stepmother too!",
            "How do you steal someone that wasn\u2019t with anyone, Hollywood needs an intervention, these people are so petty and weird \ud83d\ude02",
            "But isn't everyone someone's ex's and dating/ married someone's ex's? \ud83e\udd14 we are all someone's exes\ud83d\ude02",
            "How do you steal someone\u2019s ex lmao?",
            "No one can steal anyone away.  If a man/woman wants to stay with you. They would stay.  Don\u2019t blame the other woman/man.  If they don\u2019t want you they would leave and it\u2019s to let him or her go.  Don\u2019t fight over anyone. Know your worth, self love comes first and know it happened for a reason. You will find better and often. Karma is a bitch.",
            "I don't have it in me to do something like that, I follow the \"girl code\" but if GiGi is okay with it, as awkward as it may seem to us BUT if they were crushing on each other BEFORE GiGi, and the universe brought them back together to see what happens, why not?!?! But I wouldn't wreck my friendships over a dude...next! \ud83e\udd37",

            "Surprised the Beliebers haven't gone in on Hailey. Saw an interview w Justin and Hailey was in the background. Justin said Hailey gets mad at him for being happy when Hailey isn't around. Hailey chimed in and agreed that Justin should only be happy if he's w her and he should be sad if she's not. That's some next level cray. Wanting your spouse to be miserable if they're not in your presence is wild.",
            "I am proud of selena but she needs to stop rescuing these bullies and mean girls.i also suffer from bi polar depression anxiety and ptsd disorders.so I can relate to selena I am also a kind genuine person some people also take advantage of my kindness",

Blaming fans for making something out of nothing is an insult to the fan\u2019s intelligence. I'm Selena's fans forever but I'm not as forgiving as her. I will never tolerate body shaming and bullying or making fun of someone who has Lupus.",
            "Selena forgiving is the only way she receives her Blessings from GOD",

            "I'm Selena's fans forever but I'm not as forgiving as her..\ud83d\ude02I will never tolerate body shaming and bullying.. Because Hailey, Justin and her friends bully her they deserve the hate and more..They need to feel how their victims feel as well so that next time if they pick their victim they're going to think twice first..I hope they will never do this again..",
            "For me to believe an attention seeker I need to see those threats first! \nI respect Selena for always taking the high road and all that but damn girl you truly look like a walk over right now, you did not owe her anything, and she still has not apologized, then Selena follows her first also right after her post? It still takes Hailey a while before she does the same.. Then minutes after that Hailey's irrelevant friend on that video shades Selena again . \nSelena there comes a time you need to stand up against the bullies girl, you are a role model to many young girls and what you are teaching them right now is that they should just take the bullying and rollover and ask for more, That is weak in my eyes, Miley had to fight your battles, and I know Selena did not ask for this but then end it once and for all cause these bitches are going to do this again , their lives are horrible so they are bound to take it out on you everytime they need to lash out.",

Whoever he get involved with they are going to have problems also. It's not normal to be married for almost 5 yrs and realize you still in love with your last girl friend.  Somethings upstairs is not right in the brain department. Hailey has the same sad look that Selena use to have when she was involved with Justin, and they both have the same sad look that Justin have all the time. Justin don't need no wife or girlfriend until he find himself, meaning find out what's really going on.",

I knew her name and her face.  But the first time I heard her interviewed, I absolutely adored her.  That was before the toxic Chris Brown stories.  Am always ready to cheer her on, and there are some of her songs that take up residence in my head that hate to leave. So, guess Im more of a fan than I thought.",

Kris should be cancelled just for that alone... Forbes should be embarrassed...",

            "I think Kylie is just a big fan. When you are a fan, rich or poor, you would copy or imitate your idol and that makes you happy, giggle, cry, etc. In fact some celebrities feel so honored if they are idolized, imitated in outfits, in talent even thuogh they can not level up. That is normal. It so happen that Kylie is a celebrity of her own. But it does not mean that she can not be a fan anymore and that does not stop her from admiring and idolizing someone. But instead, they are being named as copycats. Kendall, she used to love her music but she was insulted instead.\n Ri maybe a famous singer, but hating people makes her look ugly. \nBeautywise, her face, no matter how natural is it, is not pretty. She is just being recognized bec of her voice. Yes, I like her songs. But facewise,...\nAs for the Jenners/K., they maybe surgically enhanced, but we all know that they were physically beautiful even before the surgery.",
            "Those Kardashians are a problem . Love Rihanna.",
            "I like Kendal, she is dedicated to her image in a healthy way I like that she knows how important mental health and self improvement is. Kim gives great advice she has a very pure insight and is always eager to please people. She works hard and appreciates her familys help I don't like Kylie I think that she's so privileged and that she thinks she's hard done by even though life was handed to her on a silver platter. She was a brat to her mother as a child and would always choose her social life over spending time with her family which the others just don't do. I also think she's quite cocky with the way that she thinks she's prettier than some because don't get me wrong she is gorgeous but.. Her face is 99% fake and same goes with her body. How can she thinks she has the right to look down on people when her face isn't real skin? Moving on I adore Kris and her drive she is an amazing mother. She's a crybaby and privilege but owns it. She's lived long enough to really not give a fuck about what others think and she shows time and time again that she lives for her girls. I think she could have shown more support to Robert over the years but every mother has her flaws and she's used to having the girl be straight up and front about their problems which Rob isn't he'll always bottle them up and expect someone to notice. Which Kris sadly hasn't. Khloe is the one of the strongest women I know on par to my mum. Over the last two decades she has had so much crap happen to her and she's still herself. I would definitely get along with her so we'll considering she is loud and opinionated and I love people like that. And Kourtney.. KOURTNEY! I love and worship Kourtney God bless her. She is exactly what I strive to be like. Kourtney is the sister who reminds her family that yes we have money and so I will use it and not hide it. She is a vegan so she actually must be a very soft spoken person. She values family over family and over all kindness over who's the best sibling. She respects Scott even though he out her threw so much. She reminds herself that he is broken and still deserves love. He is also the father of her children and is entitled to be in their lives no matter what and that she had loved him for over a decade even though they're now separated. Kourtney is a good person and owns the fact that she has had 3 kids, has been divorced and remarried three time to the same guy, that she is privileged, that she doesn't care and still loves her family threw and threw...",

She actually ended up getting a small role in barney after always wanting to act (due to when her mom also tried to pursue acting & practiced which ended up helping her at a young age to learn how to stand out in her child auditions). In turn this actually gave her more opportunities to audition in Disney. She still attended school and then had to be homeschooled in order to continue working at that age. However, it took years until Selena started being able to even establish herself as an artist until she was 18 i believe thanks to her great support on the show. She never attended school after being homeschooled and graduating HS to continue to grow her career. Its not like she just stopped being poor after being on one fucking barney show or getting one of the leads in the show- it took years for her family to start being able to move, her mother to settle and family issues as well.

When you are a fan, rich or poor, you would copy or imitate your idol and that makes you happy, giggle, cry, etc. In fact some celebrities feel so honored if they are idolized, imitated in outfits, in talent even thuogh they can not level up. That is normal. It so happen that Kylie is a celebrity of her own. But it does not mean that she can not be a fan anymore and that does not stop her from admiring and idolizing someone. But instead, they are being named as copycats. Kendall, she used to love her music but she was insulted instead.\n Ri maybe a famous singer, but hating people makes her look ugly. \nBeautywise, her face, no matter how natural is it, is not pretty. She is just being recognized bec of her voice. Yes, I like her songs. But facewise,...\nAs for the Jenners/K., they maybe surgically enhanced, but we all know that they were physically beautiful even before the surgery.",

Kim gives great advice she has a very pure insight and is always eager to please people. She works hard and appreciates her familys help I don't like Kylie I think that she's so privileged and that she thinks she's hard done by even though life was handed to her on a silver platter. She was a brat to her mother as a child and would always choose her social life over spending time with her family which the others just don't do. I also think she's quite cocky with the way that she thinks she's prettier than some because don't get me wrong she is gorgeous but.. Her face is 99% fake and same goes with her body. How can she thinks she has the right to look down on people when her face isn't real skin? Moving on I adore Kris and her drive she is an amazing mother. She's a crybaby and privilege but owns it. She's lived long enough to really not give a fuck about what others think and she shows time and time again that she lives for her girls. I think she could have shown more support to Robert over the years but every mother has her flaws and she's used to having the girl be straight up and front about their problems which Rob isn't he'll always bottle them up and expect someone to notice. Which Kris sadly hasn't. Khloe is the one of the strongest women I know on par to my mum. Over the last two decades she has had so much crap happen to her and she's still herself. I would definitely get along with her so we'll considering she is loud and opinionated and I love people like that. And Kourtney.. KOURTNEY! I love and worship Kourtney God bless her. She is exactly what I strive to be like. Kourtney is the sister who reminds her family that yes we have money and so I will use it and not hide it. She is a vegan so she actually must be a very soft spoken person. She values family over family and over all kindness over who's the best sibling. She respects Scott even though he out her threw so much. She reminds herself that he is broken and still deserves love. He is also the father of her children and is entitled to be in their lives no matter what and that she had loved him for over a decade even though they're now separated. Kourtney is a good person and owns the fact that she has had 3 kids, has been divorced and remarried three time to the same guy, that she is privileged, that she doesn't care and still loves her family threw and threw...",

She had to start working at a young age to be able to bring more money for her family since she had to support her young single mother which had already been working 3 jobs. She actually ended up getting a small role in barney after always wanting to act (due to when her mom also tried to pursue acting & practiced which ended up helping her at a young age to learn how to stand out in her child auditions). In turn this actually gave her more opportunities to audition in Disney. She still attended school and then had to be homeschooled in order to continue working at that age. However, it took years until Selena started being able to even establish herself as an artist until she was 18 i believe thanks to her great support on the show. She never attended school after being homeschooled and graduating HS to continue to grow her career. Its not like she just stopped being poor after being on one fucking barney show or getting one of the leads in the show- it took years for her family to start being able to move, her mother to settle and family issues as well. Anyways, believe what you want but at least do fucking research or something before you speak.",

The Kardashians are at the beginning of the end(My opinion) and it is sad to watch so much potential fail because ALL of them choose to behave in very ugly ways.. I feel bad for Salena I wish I could hug her and protect her,this is nothing more than the mean kids, Kardashian/Bieber style. In my opinion Bieber isn't a nice person and is going to destroy everything good.(In my opinion)\r\n\r\nSelena deserves someone kind and full of love and respect.\r\n All in all grow the %$#@ up people and do something worth us watching,use all that ugliness and make changes in the world that people in your place could make!!!!\r\n Selena- you are beautiful and so precious don't let these people get to you.. Best way to fight back is live a successful happy productive life,focus on the things and people that make you happy and up-lift you,surround yourself with love and positivity.. If i could I would spank every mean person(That should have been done a long time ago) that i could but spanking is against the law now days... So the ignore button works great. Live a happy life haters HATE to see you succeed,so go be successful :}",

Maybe Selena needs to hire extra security. These women are crazy & they just might incite their crazy fans.

Yes she grew up in a family that has been known for various things and I'm guessing insecurity, peer pressure from her family and FOMO in the lime light further encouraged her to the surgical specialist.\n\nKylie should remember that she is a fixer upper and the modifications (regardless how small) is what caused her to evolve. By the way I 'm not saying that she was fugly but she is now polished.\n\nIf she (Kylie) feels comfortable in her skin at this point of her life because of her altered looks all well and good.\n\nBut she and her comrade is using their time and energy to pull down another woman who is comfortable in her own skin is a sign of immaturity. It's obvious they're still stuck somewhere in their teenage years thinking that it's alright to troll on others.\n\nSelena has so much talent (singing and acting).

            "No offense to others. But to me, it seems that everyone dragged Kylie into the situation from the post Selena posted; it was on her story, and people can not see something from that a while later compared to a picture, and even then, if you follow multiple people other posts might overshadow others. On the mason IG thing, no offense to Kourtney, but her parenting style is not the greatest, and mason might post this. He is a kid and doesn't understand how bad it is, and most of this thought came from KUWTK, especially on Kourtney and her kids with their behavior with the nannies. And personally do hate this is a per, personal opinion, but Jordyn gives me red-flag behavior. She does, and this isn't a rational reason, merely a gut reason. Personally, if my gut tells me not to pay attention to certain celebrities, I will follow it, although the reason might be because of how she behaved during her and Triston scandal; no offense, but instead of explaining to your best friend what happened and instead choosing to go on an interview seems like red flag behavior, mainly because you're dealing with your best friend\u2019s sister who has a child with the person \u201cyou made out with\u201d (I don't remember all the details). How you behave in the scene says a lot about what kind of person you are.\n\nFYI, I'm a huge Selena fan, and I barely give Hailey a glance at me. I only know because she married Bieber, so I don't know what the drama is really about, except people are still upset that Julena (did I spell that right?) is broken up and Justin is married someone that isn't Selena. Honestly, I only watched this video because it has Kylie, Selena, and Jordyn; Hailey isn't someone I can glance at.",
            "Go Jordyn you knew these people and what ugly things they have done God bless you",
            "im so confused to how people are supporting Jordyn woods. first of all, Kylie didn't do anything to her other than cutting her off when Jordyn mingled with her best friend's sister's boyfriend. I don't think it was right for Khloe to only bash on Jordyn in the aftermath instead of equally if not, putting more blame on Tristan, but isn't that also her relationship, her life, and her decision? I don't think she was harsh to Jordyn specifically with how she reacted to the situation at all. it's understandable to be angry at someone for pulling something like that behind your back when you've let the person into your life as well as have helped them with their career by having her model for her jeans company? I don't think the hate is necessary, but supporting Jordyn? literally for what? lol honestly, I don't understand the balls of that woman to be coming for kylie or their family of any sort. If I were her, I would be embarrassed af about my actions tbh.",

By the way I 'm not saying that she was fugly but she is now polished.\n\nIf she (Kylie) feels comfortable in her skin at this point of her life because of her altered looks all well and good.\n\nBut she and her comrade is using their time and energy to pull down another woman who is comfortable in her own skin is a sign of immaturity.

But to me, it seems that everyone dragged Kylie into the situation from the post Selena posted; it was on her story, and people can not see something from that a while later compared to a picture, and even then, if you follow multiple people other posts might overshadow others. On the mason IG thing, no offense to Kourtney, but her parenting style is not the greatest, and mason might post this. He is a kid and doesn't understand how bad it is, and most of this thought came from KUWTK, especially on Kourtney and her kids with their behavior with the nannies. And personally do hate this is a per, personal opinion, but Jordyn gives me red-flag behavior. She does, and this isn't a rational reason, merely a gut reason. Personally, if my gut tells me not to pay attention to certain celebrities, I will follow it, although the reason might be because of how she behaved during her and Triston scandal; no offense, but instead of explaining to your best friend what happened and instead choosing to go on an interview seems like red flag behavior, mainly because you're dealing with your best friend\u2019s sister who has a child with the person \u201cyou made out with\u201d (I don't remember all the details). How you behave in the scene says a lot about what kind of person you are.\n\nFYI, I'm a huge Selena fan, and I barely give Hailey a glance at me. I only know because she married Bieber, so I don't know what the drama is really about, except people are still upset that Julena (did I spell that right?) is broken up and Justin is married someone that isn't Selena. Honestly, I only watched this video because it has Kylie, Selena, and Jordyn; Hailey isn't someone I can glance at.",

I don't think it was right for Khloe to only bash on Jordyn in the aftermath instead of equally if not, putting more blame on Tristan, but isn't that also her relationship, her life, and her decision? I don't think she was harsh to Jordyn specifically with how she reacted to the situation at all. it's understandable to be angry at someone for pulling something like that behind your back when you've let the person into your life as well as have helped them with their career by having her model for her jeans company? I don't think the hate is necessary, but supporting Jordyn? literally for what? lol honestly, I don't understand the balls of that woman to be coming for kylie or their family of any sort.

What Ukraine is doing in Bahkmut is actually a strategy, born out of need. They ARE slowly pulling back, only meter by meter, to keep the Russian troops coming. They have a number of dug-in defenses. That is why Russia has lost TONS of equipment they cannot replace, as well as tens of thousands of troops. Ukraine sends enough troops to \"look\" undermanned, and just enough to keep holding their positions as needed. Yes, there is obviously a cost, but it is far less than Russia's costs. I'm sure someone in Putin's staff realized this long ago, but Putin would not even hear about it. While they are holding a huge amount of Russian troops at bay in Bahkmut, for month after month, you can be sure that they have already made \"other\" plans for other areas. When they are \"ready\", you may see a withdrawal away from Bahkmut (to save the remaining troops), and a new, strong, offensive in an undisclosed area. Bahkmut may be \"given up\" temporarily. for a better cause. You may see this happen in the next month or so.",

            "\u00a0@\u266c JAXTHEFUNNY \u266c\u00a0 The last part is untrue. The \"defender\" part is fact. The problem is that you give Russia a 10 to 1 artillery rate, and in reality, it is most likely about 4 to 1, as Ukraine has brought in a LOT of far more accurate artillery to that area in the past few months. So, the casualty rate favoring the Russians at 8 to 1 is highly unrealistic, and doesn't take into acct the massive losses of equipment on the Russian side. Both sides are losing heavily, but Russia is, by far, getting the worst of it, as they are the attacker. The Ukrainians are using an actual wartime strategy that Putin has failed to see. I'm sure his generals noticed it, but he most likely didn't listen to them. Ukrainians are dug-in, and it is set to \"retreat\" a slow bit at a time. INTENTIONALLY! They go back meter by meter, while making the Russians pay a heavy toll for each meter. Ukraine wil not admit defeat, simply bc they WANT the Russians there! They will send in just enough reinforcements to hold what they need, keep looking weak enough so that Russia will continue to send in troops, And, they will continue to grind them up! Yes, there is a cost, but FAR heavier on the Russian side. When they are \"prepared\" for another offensive in another location, they may pull back their Bahkmut troops, and send them to another place. Russia will act as if it has won something, but, in reality, they would have gotten a destroyed, abandoned city at an extremely high cost.",

            "\u00a0@\u266c JAXTHEFUNNY \u266c\u00a0 The last part is untrue. The \"defender\" part is fact. The problem is that you give Russia a 10 to 1 artillery rate, and in reality, it is most likely about 4 to 1, as Ukraine has brought in a LOT of far more accurate artillery to that area in the past few months. So, the casualty rate favoring the Russians at 8 to 1 is highly unrealistic, and doesn't take into acct the massive losses of equipment on the Russian side. Both sides are losing heavily, but Russia is, by far, getting the worst of it, as they are the attacker. The Ukrainians are using an actual wartime strategy that Putin has failed to see. I'm sure his generals noticed it, but he most likely didn't listen to them. Ukrainians are dug-in, and it is set to \"retreat\" a slow bit at a time. INTENTIONALLY! They go back meter by meter, while making the Russians pay a heavy toll for each meter. Ukraine wil not admit defeat, simply bc they WANT the Russians there! They will send in just enough reinforcements to hold what they need, keep looking weak enough so that Russia will continue to send in troops, And, they will continue to grind them up! Yes, there is a cost, but FAR heavier on the Russian side. When they are \"prepared\" for another offensive in another location, they may pull back their Bahkmut troops, and send them to another place. Russia will act as if it has won something, but, in reality, they would have gotten a destroyed, abandoned city at an extremely high cost.",
